# CS5100_Final_Project

Note: The Q-Learning and Decision Tree Classifier, along with the Dataset used is on the main page. 
The Long Short Term Memory Neural Network code is in an ipynb file within the LSTM folder.
The dataset for the LSTM model in the folder is too large to upload to github, so a link to it is attached to it on kaggle.
Will also attach in the pdf paper.
